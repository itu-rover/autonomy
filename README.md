# Autonomous Simulation Repository

In this repository you can find different simulations developed for autonomous navigation of the rover. These simulations are made mainly using Matlab and Unity.

We have tried to implement a navigation algorithm without using the magnetometer, thus not knowing the yaw angle of the rover.

All of these algorithms were tested and combined, then implemented in the rover, where the codes can be found in ros and electronic repositories of the team.
